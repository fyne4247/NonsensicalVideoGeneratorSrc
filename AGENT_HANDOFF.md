# Platform planning handoff — 2026-11-01

## Objective and acceptance criteria
Owner asks to get NVG running natively on macOS and/or Linux where practical, with Wine as fallback, and explicitly assigns macOS planning to Opus and Linux planning to Sol. Current deliverable is two evidence-based plans and a consolidated recommendation; implementation is not started. Owner subsequently approves native installers alongside Windows installers and designates `ssh 750` as the Linux test host (booting). Owner does not control the existing Steam listing; recommendation is local/community installers first, without Steam publishing.

Plans must identify Windows dependencies, native feasibility risks, file/task boundaries, dependency order, verification requirements and fallback criteria. No runtime support may be claimed without actual verification.

## Repository state
- Team branch: atmux-NonsensicalVideoGeneratorSrc-team-flow-1101-0201.
- Baseline/integration before planning: 58ecdd1b93d2035a1f9df60119cd82a7544692ba.
- Team worktree: /Users/fish4247/.atmux/teams/NonsensicalVideoGeneratorSrc/flow-1101-0201/worktree.
- Initial tracked/untracked working tree clean. public submodule is uninitialized at recorded commit 38995cb4a419b7e511f1f1d462e01fb5b0dcbf5c.
- Target main is checked out at /Users/fish4247/Vibecoding/NonsensicalVideoGeneratorSrc. No merge/push/deployment performed. Planning records stay on the team branch pending review; do not merge implementation that does not exist.

## Assignments and current state
- Sol: PLAN_LINUX.md, this handoff. Linux repository audit and plan complete; combined direction approved by Opus, findings incorporated.
- Opus (flow-1101-0201-opus): PLAN_MACOS.md in the shared team worktree/branch. macOS investigation and combined review complete. PLAN_MACOS.md finalized and handed to Sol for checkpoint; Opus stopped editing. No separate worker branches or worktrees created. Linux/handoff checkpoint: 71a70e1 (flow: plan). macOS plan and final reconciliations are included in the final planning checkpoint.
- Sol is the single handoff writer. Opus edits only PLAN_MACOS.md.

## Findings and recommendation
One shared native DesktopGL build is the candidate for both platforms, with WindowsDX retained as default. Feasibility remains provisional: vendored video playback/native FFmpeg ABI, managed assembly architecture and native Steamworks artifacts must be tested. Additional Windows coupling includes dialogs, clipboard, speech, shell/process control, paths, Lua frame paths and System.Drawing.Bitmap thumbnail decoding.

Linux already has an upstream documented Proton route, but scripts hardcode install paths/prefix and contain quoting/download defects. It is the fallback to harden if a bounded native launch/preview/render trial fails without a major rewrite. macOS wrapper feasibility is weaker and must be separately tested.

Do not treat upstream Ubuntu testing claims or static source inspection as live compatibility. Do not silently drop preview, narration or stock effects. Preserve release ownership checks, existing saves/plugins/media, Windows behavior and licensing. No paid software, account changes, system setup, Steam uploads, pushes or destructive cleanup authorized by this planning task.

## Checks actually performed
- Read project/build/content configuration, Linux scripts, platform and media call sites, selected stock Lua plugins, submodule status and worktree refs.
- Verified current official MonoGame platform documentation and Microsoft's System.Drawing.Common Unix restriction; sources are in PLAN_LINUX.md.
- No dotnet/Wine on PATH during initial inspection. No builds, tests, installs, GUI launches or Linux execution performed. No automated test project found. Test-suite execution is not applicable to this documentation-only planning checkpoint; future code needs both focused tests and real GUI/render validation.
- Opus has its own platform evidence in PLAN_MACOS.md; no claim that Sol independently reran it.

## Review and approvals
- Opus final consolidated review APPROVES native-first direction with fallback. This is planning approval, not verified implementation.
- Findings resolved in plan: make S1/L1 one experimental trial first on Mac then Linux; separate DesktopGL content and intermediate outputs; replace System.Drawing.Bitmap; validate vendored playback; serialize shared large-file edits.
- Ubuntu 24.04 FFmpeg 6.1 is incompatible with the bundled FFmpeg 7 binding; budget app-local 7.1 libraries built from source, never ABI aliases.
- Owner clarification incorporated: build local installers; community build disables Steam integration by build flag, original Steam release keeps ownership checks. No claim about rights to branding/assets/public distribution. Steam publishing requires coordination with current listing controller and separate authorization.
- First read-only SSH check to owner-designated `750` timed out during boot. No remote command executed, no remote mutation. OS/tool/desktop baseline pending. Native compatibility is not verified on either OS.

## NEXT ACTION
When implementation begins, verify `ssh 750` connectivity after boot, inspect OS/architecture/tool/desktop baseline, then execute the shared native S1/L1 experiment with separate outputs and no publication. Record launch, thumbnail, audio preview and stock-effect MP4 evidence on both systems before choosing full native implementation or wrapper fallback. Build installers only after verified runtime and data-root work. Planning is complete, committed on team branch; no main merge because the broader port remains unimplemented. Nothing pushed or deployed.

## Resume check — 2026-11-01
- Owner requests reopening Opus and confirms `ssh 750` should be online.
- Read-only SSH now succeeds: Linux Mint 22.3 (Zena), Ubuntu noble base, x86_64, kernel 7.0.0-42-generic. `/usr/bin/ffmpeg` and `/usr/bin/zenity` are on PATH; dotnet, wine and kdialog were not found on the noninteractive SSH PATH. DISPLAY and WAYLAND_DISPLAY are unset in that SSH session; this does not prove no local desktop session exists.
- No remote files changed, no packages installed, no build/run attempted.
- Opus was closed at the end of the planning assignment. Sol's role explicitly prohibits creating a replacement Opus; owner must reopen Fish Flow and press r to restore it. No agent was spawned.
- NEXT ACTION: Restore Opus through Fish Flow, then send the saved plans, this Linux baseline and the owner request. Continue at the shared feasibility-trial gate rather than redoing planning.
